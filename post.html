						<q cite="https://www.moving.com/movers/moving-company-quotes.asp">According to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), there have been a growing number of complaints filed 
							against rogue movers as of late. To prevent a scam from happening to you, make sure the mover is legitimate by following the guidelines in the above answer. In addition, find a 
							moving company who performs either an in-person inspection or a video survey of your belongings before giving you a moving quote. This will ensure that your moving estimate is as 
							accurate as possible.

					<p>If you’re <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/hire-the-best-movers-for-move-2436008">hiring movers</a>, you should know the <b>type of documents</b> the moving company needs to provide 
						and what each document is for. While contracts can feel a little intimidating, knowing what each means and what you’re signing is key to having a successful and smooth move.</p>
					<h2><u><i>MOVER ESTIMATE</i></u></h2>
					<p>When the movers visit your home to assess your household good that you’ll be moving, they will provide you with a <b>copy of the moving estimate</b>. This document should 
						outline what kind of estimate it is – whether it’s a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/binding-estimate-hiring-movers-2435985">binding</a> 
						or <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/binding-estimate-hiring-movers-2435985">non-binding</a> – and how they reached the final amount. It’s important that you ask any outstanding questions 
						at this point, including if you have any items that require <b>special handling</b> as that will increase the estimated amount. Remember, this initial visit by the movers is the time
						 to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/things-to-ask-before-you-hiring-2435992">ask all the necessary questions</a>.
					</p>
					<h2><u><i>ORDER FOR SERVICE</i></u></h2>
					<p>After the first mover visit and once you’ve agreed to the estimate, you’ll receive an <b>order for service</b>. This is your official contract between you and the mover. 
						The order for service will provide you with everything you need to know about the move, including the date of pick-up, the estimated date of delivery, the estimated amount, 
						<a href="https://www.thespruce.com/file-a-moving-insurance-claim-2436158">insurance coverage</a> and terms of the contract. Terms may include cancellation policy, type of truck to be used,
						 goods that the mover will not move, and <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/moving-budget-when-moving-house-2436518">extra fees</a> that may be applicable for your 
						 specific <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/binding-estimate-hiring-movers-2435985">type of move</a>.
					</p>
					<p>The order for service is your agreement that the mover can move your things. So make sure you read this document carefully. If you disagree with something the mover has noted, 
						speak to the person in charge immediately. This is your time to negotiate and to ensure that you’re getting optimal service.
					</p>
					<h2><u><i>BILL OF LADING</i></u></h2>
					<p>This is one of the most important documents that you’ll receive from your mover. This will be given to you on <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/two-days-before-moving-day-2435844">moving day</a>
						 and it will outline your agreement of the move. The mover must have this document in order to move your things. You will be asked to sign the document stating that you agree to the terms: 
						 the <b>list of fees for service and total cost, pick up and delivery date, insurance coverage, and an agreement statement</b>. Make sure you read over this document carefully. 
						 The terms you agreed to earlier should be the same as what is listed on this form. Specifically, note the fees listed and make sure they match what you were quoted earlier. 
						 If there are any discrepancies, bring them to the mover’s attention. Do not sign the form until you’re certain of the terms. 
						 The mover will also sign the form and give you a copy which you should keep with you at all times. This is your official record of the move and your receipt of service.
					</p>
					<h2><u><i>INVENTORY SHEET</i></u></h2>
					<p>On moving day, you’ll also receive an <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/creating-home-inventory-before-you-move-2436459">inventory sheet</a> that lists everything 
						that the movers are responsible for moving. The <b>inventory sheet</b> will be filled out by the movers as they remove things from your home, tagging each item and noting the tag number on the sheet
						You should always be involved in this process to ensure that each item is tagged and recorded properly. Often, movers will insist that you record the tag numbers to ensure your full agreement 
						and that no items go missing. The inventory sheet is your guarantee that everything in your home has been properly inventoried and loaded on the truck.
					</p>
					<p>The inventory sheet will also be used to note the arrival of your things at your new home. The mover will ask that you sign the sheet after all items have been accounted for. 
						Makes sure you note any damage or missing items. These items should be flagged and the mover should sign that they are missing or damaged. This will make it easier for you to make 
						an insurance claim.
					</p>
					<h2><u><i>HIGH-VALUE INVENTORY SHEET</i></u></h2>
					<p>If you have items of high value, the mover will provide you with a separate list of items and the cost of moving each. Again, make sure the 
						items are properly tagged and that the cost reflects your <b>previous agreement</b>. Some movers will insist that they pack these items or if they are packed by you, that proper measures 
						were taken to preserve their value. These items should be inspected upon arrival at your new home to ensure they were not damaged during transit.
